\chapter{The Bayesian Approach to Confidence Interval Construction for Population Attributable Risk (PAR)} \label{bayesian-model}
In this chapter I will go over the approach proposed in paper \textit{Bayesian methods of confidence interval construction for the population attributable risk from cross-sectional studies} by Pirikahu\&al. 

\section{Mathematical Model} \label{PiriMath}
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{2 x 2 Contingency Table For n Samples}
\label{contingency-table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Exposed & $D^+$ (has disease) & $D^-$ (no disease) & Total \\ \hline
$E^+$ & a & b & a $+$ b \\ \hline
$E^-$ & c & d & c $+$ d \\ \hline
Total & a $+$ c & b $+$ d & n \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

$n$ denotes the total sample size where $a + b + c + d = n$. From the contingecy table we can see that a cross-sectional study with one exposure variable and one desease variable can be seen as a multinomial distribution with four possible outcomes that are independet from each other. These outcomes can be described with multinomial distribution as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{multinomial}
(a, b, c, d) \sim Multinomial(n, p_{11}, p_{12}, p_{21}, p_{22})
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(E^+) = \frac{a + b}{n}$: The propability of the expososed in a population.
    \item $P(E^-) = \frac{c + d}{n}$: The propability of the expososed in a population.
    \item $P(D^+) = \frac{a + c}{n}$, The propability of having the disease in a population.
    \item $p_{11} = P(D^+ \cap\ E^+) = P(D^+ | E^+)P(E^+) = P(E^+ | D^+)P(D^+) = \frac{a}{n}$: The probability of being exposed and having the disease.
    \item $p_{12} = P(D^- \cap\ E^+) = P(D^- | E^+)P(E^+) = P(E^+ | D^-)P(D^+) = \frac{b}{n}$: The probability of being exposed and not having the disease.
    \item $p_{21} = P(D^+ \cap\ E^-) = P(D^+ | E^-)P(E^-) = P(E^- | D^+)P(D^+) = \frac{c}{n}$: The probability of not being exposed and having the disease.
    \item $p_{22} = P(D^- \cap\ E^-) = P(D^- | E^-)P(E^-) = P(E^- | D^-)P(D^-) = \frac{d}{n}$: The probability of not being exposed and not having the desease.
\end{itemize}

The population attributable risk (PAR) is defined as the proportion of the disease in a population that have occured due to exposure. The PAR can be calculated with formula \ref{PARequation}. With Bayes' theorem we can rewrite the formula and by add the values from the list above we get the maximum likehood estimation function for PAR.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
PAR &= P(D^+) - P(D^+| E^-) \\
    &= P(D^+) - \frac{P(E^-|D^+)P(D^+)}{P(E^-)} \\
    &= \frac{a + c}{n} - \frac{\frac{c}{n}}{\frac{c + d}{n}} \\
    &= \frac{a + c}{n} - \frac{c}{n} \times  \frac{n}{c + d} \\
    &= \frac{a + c}{n} - \frac{c}{c + d} \\
    &= \frac{a + c}{a + b + c + d} - \frac{c}{c + d} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Prior distribution that estimates all the situations dercribed in the contingency table is: 
$\theta = (p_{11}, p_{12}, p_{21}, p_{22})$. Observed values or samples are: $x = (a, b, c, d)$. And the likelihood in respect to $p_k$ is denoted by a propability mass function: 
\begin{equation}
    f(x|\theta) = \frac{n!}{a!b!c!d!}p_{11}^ap_{12}^bp_{21}^cp_{22}^d
\end{equation}

Posterior distribution is: $p(a,b,c,d|p_{11}, p_{12},p_{21},p_{22}) = p(\theta|x) \varpropto  f (x|\theta)p(\theta)$. Due to conjugacy relationship, in relation to the prior, posterior can be found analytically. Posterior is:
\begin{equation}
    \theta|x ~ Dirichlet(a + 1, b + 1, c + 1, D^+ 1).
\end{equation}
It is computationally much less expencive to represent posteriors analytically than with MCMC simulation. \cite{Pirikahu2016BayesianMO}

Confidence interval is a frequentist consept but throug simulated data we can calculate whther the credibility interval has the frequentist coverage.
